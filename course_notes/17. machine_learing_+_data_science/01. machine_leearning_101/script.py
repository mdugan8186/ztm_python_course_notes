# ==== machine learning 101 ====

# what a machine learning expert does

# define goals/ what do we want to accomplish

# 1. import the data
# 2. clean the data
# 3. split the data. training set/ test set
# 4. create the model
# 5. check the output
# 6. improve


# 1. import the data (a csv file)

# 2. clean the data (missing labels, missing cells or data, and sometimes theres unusable data thats really bad)

# 3. slit the data (split the data into a  training set and a test set. the input is the training data to teach the machine and the output is the test data to see if its right. example 80% of the data is training data and 20% is test data)

# 4. create a model (import a library and then decide which algorithm you want to use)

# 5. check the output (we create the model [function], we have the input[training set], we check the output of our model with our test set. is the output matching the test set)

# 6. improve (we improve out output after initial tests. give it extra inputs or change the model)

# we do this until our model is inline with what we defined as a goal


# the hardest part of this process is grabbing the data.
