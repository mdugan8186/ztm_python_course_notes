# ==== tools in machine learning ====

# == data science ==
# 1. import the data
# 2. clean the data
# == machine learning ==
# 3. split the data. training set/ test set
# 4. create the model
# 5. check the output
# 6. improve


# == tools in python ==

# 1. Numpy - a library that helps us use lists and arrays in python and specifically multi-dimensional arrays

# 2. pandas - this is used for data analysis. it gives us an idea of this data frame which allows us the functionality to manipulate data in tabular structure with rows and columns

# 3. scikit-learn - this is where you import a library for algorithms

# 4. matplotlib - this is what we call a charting library. it allows us to visualize data in a nice way

# 5. Jupyter notebook - this allows us to step through out code and output and keep track of all things we've been doing. also see visualizations

# 6. Kaggle - this is a community of machine learning experts that has datasets. it has  free access to massive amounts of data that are openly accessible
