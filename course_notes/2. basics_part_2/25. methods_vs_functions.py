# ==== methods vs functions ====

# == functions == 
# these are built in functions that comes with python
# list()
# print()
# max()
# min()
# input()

# these are custom functions that we create ourselves
# def some_random_stuff():
  # pass

# these are all functions because the way we call them have parenthesis with or without an argument
# print()
# some_random_stuff()


# == methods ==
# methods are built in objects that have methods such as strings, dictionaries, sets, tuples. they are owned by an object or a datatype.
# methods are different because of how we use them. we use dot notation with them. methods have to be owned by something. whatever is to the left owns the method.
# it is possible to build your own methods with classes(you'll learn about them later)

# owner   # method
# 'hello'.capitalize()
