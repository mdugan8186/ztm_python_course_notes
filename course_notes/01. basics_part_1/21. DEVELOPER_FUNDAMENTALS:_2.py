# commenting your code

# comments are not meant to be ran by the program, they are just for the developer
# comments are made by using the pound sign (#). they can be made before or after a line of code

# when commenting the idea is that your adding valuable comments. your code should be self explanatory that is easy to read and easy to understand. if you're adding unnecessary comments to your code you may need to make your code easier to read

# booleans 
# the below comment is bad
# assign name variable a value of Dugan string
name = 'Dugan' # this assigns to a variable
is_cool = False
print(name, is_cool)

is_cool = True

print(name, is_cool)
