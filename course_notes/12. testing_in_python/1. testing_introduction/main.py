# ==== testing introduction ====

# testing is a method in software development where individual units of source code such as functions are tested to see whether they work properly, although it may not be a big part of a coding interview a lot of companies usually don't think about testing when interviewing people it becomes more important as you go through your carrier

# testing is simply another python file. for every file or module you have you'll have a test file. the test file will never run in production, it's a file we run to make sure  that before we release the file to production that everything is working properly. the customers will never see the test file


# several ways we learned to debug our code:
# pylint- this will lint our code and check the syntax and small errors as we type our code
# pyflakes- another linter (replit)
# pycharm- also has linting

# autopep8 (pep8)- this is the standard style guide for python. this makes sure our code meets a style the python community has agreed on


# testing is a higher level up after linting, it is a way to check even more of your code


# there is a built in module from the python standard library called unittest
import unittest
