# == pros and cons of libraries ==

# you want to ve careful with packages because it's not always good to use them
# you can have really good packages by really good programmers and developers, but you can also have people that are creating bad packages that are buggy and don't work well
# you will have to develop a skill on how to tell if a package is good, it's really popular, it's being maintained, this library is really popular with the community so most likely its a good package to use.
# also keep in mind that every time you add a library to your project you're adding more and more code  which means more and more bytes of data, so your project gets heavier and heavier
# before importing a library ask yourself could i just write this myself?
# unless it will be really time consuming or you don't have the expertise
