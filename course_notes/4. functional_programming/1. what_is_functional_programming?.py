# ==== what is functional programming? ====

# functional programming is all about separation  of concerns. which OOP (object oriented programming) dose as well. it's all about packaging our code into separate chunks  so that everything is well organized in each part of our code. and each part is organized in a way that makes sense based on functionality.
# separation of concerns means that each part concerns itself with one thing that it's good at. an example would be how we have classes that divide up attributes and methods
# functional programming has this idea as well, of separating concerns, but they also separate  data and functions. that's how a functional programmer views the world, instead of combining methods and attributes we separate them up  because they're two separate things.
# theres data and this data gets interacted and acted upon. but we're not going to combine both data and functions as one piece in an object like we saw in OOP.
# functional languages have an emphasis onn simplicity where data and functions are concerned, because in most functional programming paradigms we don't have this idea of classes and objects instead functions operate on well defined data structures like list and dictionaries rather than that data structure belonging to an object
# the goal of a functional programmer paradigm is the same as OOP, it's the idea of making out code:
# 1) clean/ clear and understandable
# 2) easy to extend (we can grow our code and make it better and better and have others come and extent our code)
# 3) easy to maintain
# 4) memory efficient (we're not storing information all over the place)
# 5) DRY

# unlike the 4 pillars of programming with OOP, functional programming all comes down to the concept of pure functions. the idea here is there is a separation between data of a program and the behavior of a program
