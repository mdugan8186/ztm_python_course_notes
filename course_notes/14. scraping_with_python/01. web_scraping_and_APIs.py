# there are ethical and unethical ways of scraping websites


# most webpages give you APIs (application programming interface) access in a form like Json to give you the data you need
# some websites only allow you to do this if you're a valid user. an example would be the github API where you can access different information from github. but in order for us to use it we have to create a user account and validate who we are. there are also websites like the star wars API that gives us free access, that is anyone can use it we don't need to verify that we are a user we don't have to give a token when making a request. instead we can just request data.
